# Polynomial
Add, multiply and evaluate polynomials stored as linked lists, such as:

 *     <coeff> <degree>
 *     <coeff> <degree>
 * with the GUARENTEE that degrees will be in descending order. For example:
 *      4 5
 *     -2 3
 *      2 1
 *      3 0
 * will represent the polynomial:
 *      4*x^5 - 2*x^3 + 2*x + 3
